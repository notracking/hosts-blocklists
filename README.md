# No more ads, tracking and other virtual garbage
This repository provides a host and domainname based blocklist specifically designed for use with dnsmasq.
Most entries are gathered from multiple, actively maintained sources and automatically updated, cleaned, optimized and moderated on a daily basis. The blocklists support both ipv4 and ipv6.

The optimizer makes full use of dnsmasqs capability to block entire domains such as *.doubleclick.net ([domains.txt](https://raw.github.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/domains.txt)). This reduces the chance of missing any new subdomains and significantly reduces the size of the blocklists. Hostnames that cannot be blocked on a domain level will still be listed in a regular hostname based blocklist ([hostnames.txt](https://raw.github.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/hostnames.txt)).

It's important to use both `domains.txt` and `hostnames.txt` simultaniously in dnsmasq to get full coverage!

# How to install
## Default dnsmasq setup
 - Download the following two files (or use a daily cronjob to do it automatically)
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/hostnames.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/domains.txt
```
 - Add the following lines to your dnsmasq.conf
```
conf-file=/path/to/domains.txt
addn-hosts=/path/to/hostnames.txt
```
 - Restart dnsmasq (reload will **not** update list changes) `sudo service dnsmasq restart`

## For a Pi-hole setup
Because Pi-hole does not fully support loading of dnsmasq domain filters ([details here](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/1e87850952b6d886674b487f57e47fae1c20dc8a/gravity.sh#L338)), you should add your own `.conf` file in `/etc/dnsmasq.d/`. This way you can still use our blocklists with Pi-hole, but updating has to be done by an external daily cronjob. It's also recommended to remove all default Pi-hole lists, since these are already included in our list in a more efficient manner.

 - Add the following lines to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/99-pihole-custom-lists.conf` (example filename)
```
conf-file=/path/to/domains.txt
addn-hosts=/path/to/hostnames.txt
```
 - (Optional, but recommended) Remove the default Pi-hole lists in `/etc/pihole/adlists.list`
 - Update Pi-hole `pihole -g`

## DNS over HTTPS (DOH)
DNS over HTTPS will prevent clients in your network from using the default local DNS services. Mozilla Firefox has a feature to disable DOH network wide for all clients as described [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/configuring-networks-disable-dns-over-https).

If you use [domains.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/domains.txt) in your dnsmasq configuration you will have DOH disabled on all clients by default.
